# Contributing to PHPRise Common

Thank you for considering contributing to PHPRise Common! The contribution guidelines are as follows:

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/phprise/common/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with a clear title and detailed description of the suggested enhancement.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to other users.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows the strict style guide below.

## Style Guide & Architecture

We follow a very strict set of rules to ensure high quality, maintainability, and fluid design.

### 1. Strict Typing & Standards
- **Strict Mode**: Every file must start with `declare(strict_types=1);`.
- **Strict Typing**: All properties, method arguments, and return types **must** be typed. Mixed should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.
- **PSR-12**: Follow the PSR-12 coding standard.
- **OOP**: Always use Object-Oriented Programming.

### 2. Object Calisthenics (Strict Enforcement)
1. **One level of indentation per method**: If you need more, extract a method.
2. **Don't use the `else` keyword**: Return early or check pre-conditions.
3. **Wrap all primitives and Strings**: Use Value Objects.
4. **First class collections**: Arrays should be wrapped in Collection classes.
5. **One dot per line**: Respect the Law of Demeter.
6. **Don't abbreviate**: Use full, descriptive names.
7. **Keep all entities small**: Classes under 50 lines, packages under 15 classes.
8. **No classes with more than two instance variables**: High cohesion is key.
9. **No getters/setters/properties**: Tell, Don't Ask. (Exception: DTOs may be data structures).

### 3. Clean Code & Simplicity
- **No Descriptive Comments**: Code must be self-explanatory through naming. Comments explain "why", never "what".
- **Complexity**: Keep code lean, cohesive, and simple. If it's complex, it's wrong.
- **Exceptions**:
    - Use specific exceptions, never generic `Exception`.
    - **Never** catch exceptions inside loops or recursions. Handle them at the execution level (top of the stack).

### 4. Architecture & Layers
- **No "Model" Layer**: Do not create a monolithic "Model". The model is the whole domain (Adapters, Validators, ValueObjects, etc.).
- **Specific Naming**: Avoid generic "Services". Use `StateProcessor`, `StateProvider`, `DataMapper`, `Query`, `Command`, `Connector`, `Adapter` etc.
- **Kill Middleware Layers**: If a service only delegates to a repository, delete it. Call the repository directly.
- **Infrastructure Ignorance**: The domain **must never** know about infrastructure. Never extend ORM classes (e.g., Eloquent Models).
- **No Arrays**: Do not use arrays for input/output. Use Objects or Collections.

### 5. Separation of Concerns
- **No Embedded Languages**: No HTML tags in JS/PHP. No JS strings in PHP.
- **Frontend/Backend Separation**: Use separate teams, tools, and infrastructure. No "magic wands" (fullstack coupling/monoliths) that cause future rework.
- **Componentization**: Componentize "everything" and use Composer.

### 6. Testing Manifesto
- **Do not over-test**: Don't test language contracts (e.g., if a method returns `string`, don't test that it returns a string).
- **Do not under-test**: Test everything that contains business logic or behavior.
- **Use the Right Test**:
    - **Controllers**: Use Integration/Feature/API tests. No unit logic to test here.
    - **Domain**: Use Unit tests.
- **No Duplication**: If a method is tested via another method's test, don't duplicate the test unless necessary for documentation.
